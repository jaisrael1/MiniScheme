# MiniScheme
A Scheme interpreter built in Scheme

This is a project exploring how an interpreter executes written instructions. The goal was to better understand the syntax of the Lisp family of languages and to get a firm grasp on how my code is parsed and interpreted. It is written in Scheme and will execute any valid Scheme code. 

It was made in DrRacket.
